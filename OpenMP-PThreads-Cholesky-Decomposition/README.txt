problem involved development of multi-core implementation of the Cholesky decomposition method using PThreads and OpenMP. Cholesky decomposition method is a technique for solving a system of linear equations of the form Ax = b if the matrix A is symmetric and positive definite. Numerical stability is ensured since the method does not require pivoting since the diagonal elements are positive definite.
